# Washington-D.C-AIRBNB-Visualisation-and-Storytelling
Airbnb is an online American marketplace that allows property owners to list their properties on the platform and connect with travelers who are looking for a place to stay. As a data analyst at Airbnb, we will analyze the landscape of Airbnb and develop a functional tool that Airbnb hosts can use when deciding how much to charge for their space.

# About the Project
1. Data: 
- Internally, Airbnb collects data from its website to understand how they affect the residential real estate rental market. 
- The data are freely available for public use at http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html. We choose Washington data set for this project.
2. Dashboards:
- Overview: A dashboard with an overview of Airbnb for your city. This dashboard should give the reader an overall perspective of Airbnb.

- Price: A price dashboard to enable a reader to input a price and determine how that price compares to the price for similar properties. This dashboard should make it clear whether the readerâ€™s price is aligned with the marketplace or not.
